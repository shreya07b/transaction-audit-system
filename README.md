# Transaction Audit System

The Transaction Audit System is a full-stack web application that simulates a peer-to-peer fund transfer system with a mandatory, immutable audit trail.
The system ensures that every transaction attempt (successful or failed) is recorded and retrievable for auditing purposes.

Key Objectives

Implement a reliable fund transfer API

Maintain an immutable transaction audit log

Provide a clean, responsive frontend dashboard

Demonstrate real-world backend practices such as transactions, validation, and error handling
