# Transaction Audit System

The Transaction Audit System is a full-stack web application that simulates a peer-to-peer fund transfer system with a mandatory, immutable audit trail.
The system ensures that every transaction attempt (successful or failed) is recorded and retrievable for auditing purposes.


**Key Objectives**

Implement a reliable fund transfer API

Maintain an immutable transaction audit log

Provide a clean, responsive frontend dashboard

Demonstrate real-world backend practices such as transactions, validation, and error handling


**Tech Stack**

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize ORM, SQLite ,RESTful APIs

Frontend: React (Vite), Axios, CSS (custom styling)

Tooling: Postman – API testing, Git & GitHub 

AI Tools – ChatGPT, Gemini


**Setup & Run Instructions**

**Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/transaction-audit-system.git
cd transaction-audit-system


**Backend Setup**

cd backend

npm install

npm start

-> Backend runs on: http://localhost:5000

-> SQLite database is auto-created on first run


**Frontend Setup**

cd frontend

npm install

npm run dev

->Frontend runs on: http://localhost:5173


##  API Documentation

### User APIs

#### Register User
POST /api/auth/register

Request Body:
```json
{
  "name": "Sammy",
  "email": "sammy@test.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```
Response:

-> 201 Created – User registered successfully

-> 400 Bad Request – Validation error


### Transaction APIs

#### Transfer Funds
POST /transactions/transfer

Request Body:
```json
{
  "sender_id": 1,
  "receiver_id": 2,
  "amount": 200
}
```
Behavior:

-> Uses DB transactions

-> Logs SUCCESS or FAILED status

## Database Schema

### User Table
```json
| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER | Primary Key |
| name | STRING | User name |
| email | STRING | Unique email |
| password | STRING | Hashed password |

### Transaction Table

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER | Primary Key |
| sender_id | INTEGER | Sender user ID |
| receiver_id | INTEGER | Receiver user ID |
| amount | FLOAT | Transfer amount |
| status | STRING | SUCCESS / FAILED |
| createdAt | DATETIME | Timestamp |
```

## AI-Assisted Tasks

Backend Architecture	->  Sequelize project structure

Transaction Logic	-> Implemented atomic fund transfer using DB transactions

Debugging	Identified -> API route mismatches and frontend-backend issues

Documentation	Generated -> structured README and API docs

## Effectiveness Score

Score: 4 / 5

Justification:
AI tools significantly accelerated development by reducing boilerplate work, guiding architectural decisions, assisting with debugging complex issues, and improving documentation quality. This saved several hours of development time while maintaining code clarity and correctness.
